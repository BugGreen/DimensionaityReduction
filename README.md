Dimensionality Reductions for Systems of Linear Equations

Representation of linear equations consisting of one or two variables are easy to visualize, but what happen when a set 
of linear equations of interest have three or more variables? One approach to make it possible to assign a shape to 
linear equation systems with more than 3 variables is to reduce the dimensionality of the system. In this document 
will be explored different data-driven dimensionality reduction methods to produce projections onto a 2D space, 
indicating its characteristics, advantages and disadvantages. 
Different systems of linear equations with some corresponding linear combinations will be passed to the methods to 
generate 2d projections. It will be observed if the resulting projections allow to visualize that the linear 
combinations are contained in its corresponding linear equation system.
