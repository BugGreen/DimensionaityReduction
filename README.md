# Dimensionality Reductions for Systems of Linear Equations

As a starting step for the research project, the dimensionality reduction techniques of PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP were applied to a system of linear equations together with a linear equation that is also a linear combination of the system. This first step was taken as an initial approach to discover whether, after reducing the dimensionality of the problem, any patterns and/or structures could emerge and thus visually represent any relationship between the linearly dependent equation and the system of equations. 
Nevertheless, the initial outcomes did not yield representations that provided clear and straightforward interpretability.
